{"description1":"A “Wordpress” website with additional PHP functionality was created for the client.","description2":"Task: create an event website where the user can add events to their Wishlist. A reminder could be activated for events added to the \"Wishlist\" - user would receive an e-mail remainder about the event the day before the start of the event. ","description3":"Since I was learning PHP at the time, and I hadn't even started JavaScript yet, I created the functionality with the help of PHP and a MySQL database. In the database I recorded which user has liked which events and if they are activated the event reminder. I activated a CRON job on the server that ran my code every day in the morning. The code checked whether there will be any events tomorrow and if there are people who have activated a reminder for those events. If so - information about those events were sent to those users.","title":"Website with additional PHP functionality"}
